2020/12/29  Upload two description files for Chinese characters. You should download these files and open from this runing application to get the characters drawing .

For example:

76,-64,0,-10,-5,-6,-6,-5,-5,-6,0,-6,0,-9,1,-10,-5,-64,0,-2,-9,-1,-8,-2,12,-64,0,-1,-9,3,-10,3,-10,1,-6,2,-3,0,-3,-64,0,4,-6,17,-8,-64,0,11,-7,12,-5,12,12,7,10,-64,0,3,-1,4,3,4,3,-64,0,4,-1,8,-2,9,-1,7,2,4,3,-64,-64,,,,,,



and

70,-64,0,-17,-9,-12,2,-12,-10,-7,-9,-8,-3,-11,-4,-12,-5,-12,-5,-12,-5,-11,-5,1,-19,4,-18,1,-12,3,-7,1,-5,-3,-11,-2,8,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-64,0,3,-12,21,-16,20,-16,-64,0,5,-5,12,-7,11,0,9,-4,13,-11,16,-8,14,15,14,15,-64,-64,,,,,,
